In my Systems Hardware course, we had a series of lab experiments aimed to build a fundamental understanding of computer systems at the hardware level. The primary goal was to design, construct, and test a basic digital 4 bit computer system from discrete components, exploring concepts such as memory storage, sequential logic, bus communication, and instruction execution.
